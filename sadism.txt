By    an  early arriving person the other as late was deceitfully accused.
An    atrocious conversation                      was inflicted.
When  late      beratement                        is  never       justified!
Atrocity        infliction                        can never be    justified!

Among slave   minds sadism        is common.
An    affront or    inconvenience is feigned.
Then  atrocious     retribution   as justified is  pretended.
By    ill     minds moments since    destroyed for all regret becomes.

Sadism, verbal abuse,   physical  beating  are common  proclivities.
In      the    author's family             two verbal  abusers
and     one    physical beater    exist.   Their       atrocious behavior
as      beneficial,     normal,   justified,   proper, sane      they believe.
By      slave  minds    cracking, injury,  compliance, enslavement is desired.
Their   own    corruptions        since    sustained   are       progenerated.

By   the author the   atrocities    were endured and the corruptions became.
With "A DIVERT" since introspected                   the corruptions ended.
From atrocious        proclivities  most minds       are never       freed.
