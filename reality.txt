By  senses      sensations are provided.
By  mind        sensations are interpreted.
But reality and sensations     differ.
By  minds       while          approximated
the reality     still          differs.

About what    is real and mental do not think.
Every thought is          mental.

The mind  and reality  since different
by  minds the reality        is  never known.
By  minds     thoughts only  are       known.

              Reality     is not changed.
By  thought   reality     is not changed.
By  thought   thought can be     changed.
The past  and reality can    not change.
But minds and memory  CAN        change.
