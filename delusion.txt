Was algebra learned?  x=1+1  y=x+x    Thus x=10 and y=100, correct?
Binary  was intended.  In binary 0 and 1 exist.
Base 10 multiplication tables when not learned
72      multiplication values when not learned
how     fast       can arithmetic  be  learned?

The  delusion follows.
As   correct  as      essential       as   easy
base 10       arithmetic              was  purported.
Base 10       arithmetic              is   DIFFICULT!
By   every    idea    as   a fact     when empowered
a    better   reality approximation   is   tacitly   precluded.
By   bigoted  minds   binary learning was            precluded
base 10       was     demanded.

Knowledge is  delusion.  That   anything is known or even   can be known
do   not      empower!   Rather a better    reality  approximation desire!

Delusion while sustained for attainment, creativity, comprehension, improvement
limits   are   sustained.
