Countless realizations when  attained
an        atrocity     when  encountered is  easily    spot;
most      threats                        are instantly spot.
The       agency       since ended
the       volition     since retained
the       bigoted      mind  can be challenged.

"By deceit my liberty will not be deprived!"
"By insult my liberty will not be deprived!"
"By threat my liberty will not be deprived!"
"Is justified atrocity infliction desired?"  "Is liberty denial intended?"
if  retorted  from  an assailant  a defensive    posture can be solicited.

By    bigoted  minds atrocity when inflicted as deserved as justified
since believed the   atrocity realization    is precluded.
When  revealed from  shock    volition       if attained
with  the      self  evaluation
the   bigoted  mind  must     contend.
The   agency   if    interrupted
the   atrocity       infliction for a moment could end.
