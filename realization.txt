An introspection when successful   an   idea can:
if retained      the  agency when  solicited similar    behavior becomes;
if revised       the  agency when  solicited different  behavior becomes;
if disempowered  the  agency since gone      volitional behavior resumes.

An atrocious memory when     introspected
an idea             if   not empowered
an agency           if       reinforced
a  change           is   not possible.

An agency to change the empowered idea must be discovered and revised.
An agency to end    the empowered idea must be discovered and disempowered.

The  realization to  attain
the  duration    the effort the introspection the tenacity the volition
must suffice.
