Ownership   is    delusional.
In a body   while alive every atom  is      borrowed.
In a corpse upon  death every atom  is      released.
By   self   those             atoms are not created are merely borrowed.

Land can not be owned.
Atrocities            when inflicted as  justification the ownership idea,
such as tresspassing, when cited;        actually
an      atrocity      inflicting bigoted mind exists.

The     ownership     idea  is not real     is  not physical  is  purely mental.
Control to    inflict ideas such   as       law and ownership are empowered.
How     many  ideas   as    mental manacles are     currently being worn?

By  slave minds to ideas   importance is accorded.
By  free  minds to persons importance is accorded.
Law and   liberty  since   contrary   to either, but not both,
importance      is accorded.
