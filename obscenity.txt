By  free minds words as obscene are not   empowered.
A   word is    not   embarrassing   or    vulgar.
But an   atrocity    to intended    or    inflict is.
Words    like  cunt, fanny, pecker, shit, snatch  are fucking awesome.

"Eat shit and die," when said the second    person pronoun  is implied.
From illness a painful   death           is suggested.
"[You] dick head," when insulted         to sexual intercourse attainment
too    much importance   was accorded                       is suggested.
"Fuck you," when said by violent rape    to be victimized   is suggested.
Embarrassment, powerlessness, violation  to endure          is suggested.

To  self  and  every person equal importance when accorded obscenity ends.
Rather    than hostility    soliciting obscenity; feelings why   not say?
When angry    "I am angry.  Please leave." why not say?

Obscenity use when relinquished
for sincere        communication the opportunity             is gained.
Liberty       when sustained  to do  as self fucking pleases is sustained, but
with words         atrocities to intended to suggest         is not.
