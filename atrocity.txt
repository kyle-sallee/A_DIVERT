Liberty deprivation when intended an atrocity is inflicted.

By admiration  by beratement by confinement
by deceit      by demand     by deprivation by injury by murder by law
by prosecution by punishment by obligation  by reward by threat    and
by many  other    methods       atrocities are inflicted.

An  atrocity when endured
a   decision if   made
to           an   idea
importance   was  accorded.
By  atrocity the  evaluation was     corrupted.
The decision      probably   was not rational.
By  rest     the  memory     was not normalized.

For empowered      ideas
by  atrocity  when backed
the agency    when created
the volition  is   thwarted.
