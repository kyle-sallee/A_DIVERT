Many atrocities daily while  endured
few  ideas            are    empowered
few  agents           become.

By   assailing minds
the  assailed  mind's agents when solicited
the  assailed  mind's battle is   already lost.
Self owned     agents        are  often   indomitable.

Each realization when attained   one or  more agents ends!
The  agents      when vanquished the volition resumes.

All agents   by    atrocity  when   empowered when ended a free mind became.
By  free     minds atrocious battle can       be   won.
By  bigoted  minds atrocity  when   inflicted
by  an       agent is        often  impelled.

Per agents   one   action only is  often possible.
Per volition all   actions     are       possible.
By  a  free  mind  the bigoted mind's    agents can be thwarted.
