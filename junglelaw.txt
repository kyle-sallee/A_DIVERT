Weak meat strong eat!  Every    corpse    when    eaten jungle law is affirmed.
The  enslaved    like  dumb     prey      animals behave.
The  enslavement is    allowed, demanded, wanted.
To   be                employed the       slaves  demand!
But, by jungle   law   enslavement        can not be justified!

By minds   when free
predator   and  prey      are not approximated;
capitalist and  labor     are not approximated;
persons                   are     approximated;
wealth                    is  not desired; for reality
better     approximations are     desired.

The    reality approximation when better,
better can  be accomplished
better can  be attained.
