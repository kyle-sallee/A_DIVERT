With bigoted minds the paydom brightly shines.    Age, gender,   ethnicity,
occupation, religion,  role,  wealth,  etc are    constantly     illuminated.
To   self   to others  the importance  the regard differently is accorded.

In  the past          to     "Junk for Jesus" an automobile was  donated.
Two decades  later    from   "Junk for Jesus" an automobile was  requested.
In  exchange a        motorcycle                            was  offered.
But employed battered female persons only  receive the telephone voice said.
The author   can      give,  but     NEVER receive!
For that     bigoted  mind   the     bigotry is good,  justified, righteous.

By   bigotry while blinded the eyes       are deceived the mind  is befuddled.
For  righteousness         for worthiness a   measuring    stick is missing.
Bigotry      while bright;     goodness   can not be seen.
Goodness is  felt.  Giving and receiving  feel       good.

Into  the  scary dark venture.   With the  darkness merge.
For a hand for    a voice        a person  exists.
    A hand fill.  A voice help.  A person  become.
In    the         dark to ALL      persons equal importance is accorded.
