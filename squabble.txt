Minds    while not free    by  agency are impelled.
Atrocity when  endured     squabbling can result.

The      agency    since    active
the      volition  since    precluded
the      cause     is not   realized          is  not addressed.
Instead  insults,  threats, and verbal injury are     inflicted.

By squabbling life quality  and enjoyment     are     mitigated.

By minds when free with a single sentence a squabble can often be ended.
