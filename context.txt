By   slave minds   bigotry    to  apply
the  participants' attributes and roles
must be    known.

For  free  minds
atrocity   is atrocity;
context    is irrelevant.

The  bigotry       if sustained 
the  context       is considered
the  atrocity      is obscured
the  introspection is abstained 
the  realization   is precluded
the  agency        is retained.

Behind authority
behind bigotry
behind context
behind vernacular
by     bigoted minds atrocity infliction is hid is self righteously denied.
