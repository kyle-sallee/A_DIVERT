A   martial artist  when   attacked
the combat  afore   realizing
the attack  line    can be departed and
the attack  counter can become.
By  martial artists as  a  tool
the agency  is             honed    and wielded.

With      agency honed   techniques
martial   artist persons can fight while
untrained        persons can flail and flee.
