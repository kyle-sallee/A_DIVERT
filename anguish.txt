An  atrocious memory  during introspection
the atrocities        when   spotted
a   similar   anguish can be solicited.

Anguish when surmounted can be easily endured and decisions can be revised.
Anguish when vanquished     is laughable      and decisions can be disempowered.

The duration  while  available
the tenacity  while  sufficient
the atrocious memory until laughable can be hacked.

The anger       while hot
the fear        while insurmountable
the pain        while insufferable
the retribution while desired
the decision    might not disempower might not revise.
