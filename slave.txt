The word slave                  is not an insult.
However, enslavement infliction is     an insult.

Liberty when deprived a slave results.

Sans payment             birthright use         is deprived.
For  continued existence birthright use         is required.
With enslavement    when compliant  some script is attained.
With enslavement    when inflicting more script is attained.
With slave script   the  birthright use         is purchased.

For  slaves
by   lethal deprivation
continued   existence
is   daily  tacitly   threatened.

From the film, "Blade Runner."
"Quite an experience to live in fear isn't it?
 That's what it is to be a slave."
