Deshi, "My mind is free.  I hate deprevation.  I want wealth.  I will enslave!"

Sensei,
"A crippling   illness when     cured
 a professional sports career   is not     tacitly attained.
 Control     to attain atrocity infliction while   endorsed
 a mind      is not    free.
 Juicy and   delicious while    thought    and     enjoyed
 to    the   cancer    and      coronary   heart   disease   that follows
 to    agony to death  to       suffering  the     ignorance when feigned
 the   experience can  be       directly           attained."

Deshi, "Fuck you, sensei!"

Sensei,
"For self   the control while delegated
 for others the control is    desired."

Deshi,  "Up yours, sensei!  I'm gonna be filthy rich!"
Sensei, "For how many lifetimes will being wealthy suffice?"
