With    activity  chronic   pain can wax    or wane.
Chronic pain   by agency    when not caused by volition can be resisted.
Unfortunately, by resisting tenacity        is depleted.

By agency the  chronic   pain   if resisted then concentration is depleted.
By the    body seemingly limitless pain can be       produced.
By the    bioputer       limitless mflop    is   not produced.

Pain while endured volition is  inhibited and
less than  ideal   outcomes are solicited.
