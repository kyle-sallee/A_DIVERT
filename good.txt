An innate evil an    innate good   while postulated
a  bioputer    is    logical.
A  decision    until made inaction and   indecision exists.
A  decision    when  made   action follows.

Control when intended such actions as evil are     classified.
Liberty when intended such actions as good are     classified.
But     good          and  evil            are     ideas.
Good    persons       and  evil persons    do  not exist.

Atrocity when abstained liberty is attained.
Liberty  when attained  freedom is attained.

Enslavement when  endured   some      wealth   is  attained.
Enslavement when  inflicted more      wealth   is  attained.
With wealth slave produced  goods and services are attained.

An  atrocious enslaved world when already provided
to  comply to sustain  is    logical,     unless
the game   as unworthy as    unwanted was decided.
