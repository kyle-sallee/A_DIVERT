Among  the      possibility plethora
for    first    attempts  a success
since           seldom      attained
worthy goals    to          attain
the    tenacity must        suffice.

In the freedom liberty since sustained tenacity is honed.
In the  paydom liberty since deprived  tenacity is deprived.

By   agency      when limited tenacity is   scarce.
When not              limited
for  goal attainment  greater duration when required when sustained
the  tenacity     is  tacitly honed.

By   free minds near     limitless  tenacity      can be   attained.
The  tenacity   as       decisions  exist.
A    worthy     goal for attainment a half decade can seem short.

Among minds tenacity varies.  Quick quitters exist.
