"A DIVERT" while       awesome can    be    read and change might not follow.
On paydom  worlds      slave   minds  best  fit.
Befuddled, controlled, enslaved       to    remain
while      not         rational       is    logical.

The change to become   discontentment is    essential.
On  paydom    Earth    discontentment while abundant
the implied   death    threat,
the comply    or die   threat,        is    potent.
The paydom    Earth    menticide      is    potent.
The slave     minds                   are   terrified.

A   free      mind     to become      as    suicide     while        surmised
by  slave     minds    a  banal             meaningless existence is sustained.

Compliance while easy; defiance       is    difficult and failure is possible.
The paydom Earth as    sufficient     if    decided 
the self   the         improvement    the   liberty   for attainment
for the    next  life                 or    eternity  why not        wait?
By  self   that  must                 be    decided.
