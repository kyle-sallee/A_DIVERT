Optimal  outcomes  to   attain
optimal  decisions must become.
Adequate reality   approximations,  consideration, duration, and volition
are      required.
By       agents    when deprived
the      agents    why  sustain?

An  atrocity when       endured
the life     when  not  ended   a   success              was approximated.
The agency   when       created the success   attainment is  expedited.
The life     preservation           potential            is  improved.
The agency   while      fast        might     not        be  rational nor ideal.

In  an  automobile by volition the destination can be decided
but the driving    by agency                       is accomplished.

In the film "Enter the Dragon" by Bruce Lee agency was described,
"When the opponent expand I contract.  When it contracts I expand.
 When there is an opportunity... I do not hit!  It hits all by itself."
