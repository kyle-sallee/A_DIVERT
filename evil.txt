The  word live      backwards  when     spelled
the  word evil      becomes.
Evil and  death are not                 synonymous.
Evil and  and       backwards  life are tantamount.

Liberty  when inflicted development and growth      are encouraged.
Atrocity when inflicted compliance  and enslavement are coerced.

As  slaves    when living    what life could be  more backwards?  Not a slave?
For continued      existence is   payment    and law  compliance  not demanded?

Lethal deprivation when constantly resisted
for    enslavement infliction
for    enslavement compliance
the    temptation  is   constant.

For    decades for    lifetimes evil only when seen the contrast is missing.
The    paydom  normal life   is evil.
