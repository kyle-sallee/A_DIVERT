Agency   is simple   and fast.  Like vehicle  driving  agency   uses exist.
Volition is adaptive but slow.  When possible superior outcomes are  attained.

The optimal  outcome and
the rapid    outcome while seldom similar
the duration when    constrained
the inaction could   be    fatal.

For decision
the duration     when not        constrained
by  volition the best outcome is approximated.
