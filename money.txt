Credit, debt, money, also called slave script, is  a delusion.
In      slave minds  only those  ideas         are empowered.

An  abject deprivation system when inflicted
by  slave  script
the slave  produced goods
the slave  produced services
are attained.

Enslavement
when compliant less wealth is attained
when inflicted more wealth is attained.

Enslavement when desired slave script attainment is desired.
Better      when desired liberty      attainment is desired.
Both        can  not  be concurrently attained.
